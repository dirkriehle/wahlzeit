<p>
	Oops, so we have to write some legalese... 
	Well, here we go, the terms and conditions of using this website.
</p>

<h2>Terms and Conditions v1.0</h2>

<p>
	This site lets you show, discuss, and praise photos.
	You can upload your own photos and you can search for specific photos.
</p>

<p>
	As a user, you agree to use this service in a lawful way,
	meaning you won't violate any of your country's laws. 
	(Specifically, that means you won't upload material
	for which you don't have the copyright or permission to upload.) 
	Also, you agree not to violate any of the laws of the United States of America, 
	Germany, or those of the peaceful nation of Terra Incognita.
	You grant us the non-exclusive right
	to use any photo that you upload or any data that you provide as we think best.
</p>

<p>
	The service is provided as is and no guarantees are made whatsoever 
	with respect to this service's availability or fitness for use. 
	No warranties are given or implied.
	Basically, we maintain the right to change the service in any way we like,
	without further notice, and without any constraints.
</p>

<p>
	Having said this, we want the service to be useful, 
	so we do want to listen to you 
	to make this a service you really like to use! 
	Even if we are so fearful that somebody sues us over nothing 
	that we came up with these terms and conditions. 
	(Not that we know of something that we could be sued for!)
</p>

<p>
	Well, that wasn't that bad.
	Of course we also reserve the right to change these terms and conditions,
	in particular to put them into proper legalese so that nobody will understand them anymore.
	Finally, if any clause of these terms is found to be invalid, for example, 
	you don't believe that Terra Incognita is a peaceful nation, 
	then just that clause is invalidated and the rest still stands.
</p>

<p>
	By using this service, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions.
</p>
